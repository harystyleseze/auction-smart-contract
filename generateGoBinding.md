Here's the complete sequence of commands from start to end, including all the fixes:

1. First, compile the contract:
```bash
cd english-auction
forge build --force
cd ..
```

2. Create the api/auction directory with correct permissions:
```bash
mkdir -p api/auction
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER api/
chmod -R 755 api/
```

3. Extract the ABI and bytecode (using -r flag to remove quotes):
```bash
jq -r '.abi' english-auction/out/EnglishAuction.sol/EnglishAuction.json > EnglishAuction.abi
jq -r '.bytecode.object' english-auction/out/EnglishAuction.sol/EnglishAuction.json > EnglishAuction.bin
```

4. Generate the Go bindings:
```bash
abigen --abi EnglishAuction.abi \
    --bin EnglishAuction.bin \
    --pkg auction \
    --out api/auction/auction.go
```

5. Clean up the temporary files:
```bash
rm EnglishAuction.abi EnglishAuction.bin
```

6. Verify the generated file exists:
```bash
ls -l api/auction/auction.go
```

That's it! The file `api/auction/auction.go` should now contain your contract bindings and be ready to use with your Go code. 

If you ever need to regenerate the bindings (for example, after modifying your smart contract), just run these commands again in the same order.

Go bindings for MyNFT

I'll help you generate the Go bindings for your MyNFT contract. Here are the steps:

1. First, compile your Solidity contract to get the ABI and bytecode. Since you're using Foundry, you can use `forge`:

```bash
cd english-auction
forge build
```

This will generate the artifacts in `out/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json`

2. Extract the ABI and bytecode from the JSON file. Create two files:
- `MyNFT.abi` - containing only the ABI
- `MyNFT.bin` - containing only the bytecode (without '0x' prefix)

3. Install `abigen` if you haven't already:
```bash
go install github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/abigen@latest
```

4. Generate the Go bindings using `abigen`. Run this command from your `api` directory:
```bash
abigen --abi ../english-auction/out/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json --bin ../english-auction/out/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json --pkg auction --type MyNFT --out auction/mynft.go
```

5. The generated file `mynft.go` will be placed in your `auction` package directory alongside your existing `auction.go` file.

6. Update your imports in `handler.go` to use the generated bindings:


```16:17:api/handler.go
	contract "api/auction"
)
```


The generated bindings will be in the same package as your Auction contract, so you can use them directly through the `contract` alias.

After following these steps, the error about undefined `NewMyNFT` should be resolved, and you'll be able to interact with your NFT contract through the Go bindings.

Make sure your `go.mod` has all the required dependencies. Based on the error messages shown in your doc.md, you might need to run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This will ensure all required dependencies are properly installed.
