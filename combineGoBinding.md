I see the issue. The error occurs because the MyNFT contract uses OpenZeppelin libraries. We need to use the combined JSON output from Forge to generate the bindings correctly. Here's how to fix it:

1. First, generate the combined JSON output from Forge:
```bash
cd english-auction
forge build --combined-json bin,abi > combined.json
```

2. Then, use the combined JSON to generate the Go bindings:
```bash
cd ../api
abigen --combined-json ../english-auction/combined.json --pkg auction --type MyNFT --out auction/mynft.go
```

3. Also, you need to add back the ethclient import in main.go since it's used for the Dial function:

```go:api/main.go
import (
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"

    contract "api/auction"
)
```

4. And remove the unused ethclient import from handler.go:

```go:api/handler.go
import (
    "errors"
    "math/big"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/accounts/abi/bind"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"

    contract "api/auction"
)
```

After making these changes, run:
```bash
go mod tidy
go run .
```

This should properly generate the MyNFT bindings with all the required library dependencies included.

============================

this worked

I see the issue. The error occurs because MyNFT uses OpenZeppelin libraries. Let's try a different approach:

1. First, let's fix the missing imports in `main.go`:

```go:api/main.go
package main

import (
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"

    contract "api/auction"
)
```

2. Then, run the following commands to install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd api
go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
```

3. For the MyNFT contract, we need to flatten the contract first to include all dependencies. In the english-auction directory:
```bash
cd ../english-auction
forge flatten src/MyNFT.sol > MyNFT.flat.sol
```

4. Now compile the flattened contract and generate bindings:
```bash
cd ../api
solc --abi --bin ../english-auction/MyNFT.flat.sol -o build
abigen --abi build/MyNFT.abi --bin build/MyNFT.bin --pkg auction --type MyNFT --out auction/mynft.go
```

This approach:
1. Flattens the contract to include all OpenZeppelin dependencies
2. Uses solc directly to compile the flattened contract
3. Generates the bindings from the flattened output

After these steps, run:
```bash
go mod tidy
go run .
```

This should resolve both the dependency issues and the library reference error.
